<h1 align="center">Expense Tracker App</h1>

## üìú Description:
Developed the **Expense Tracker** Android application to manage daily expenses with a simple and clean UI built in **Jetpack Compose**.
The app allows users to record and view expenses for any date using a **custom horizontal scrolling calendar**, making it easy to check past expenses and track spending habits.  
All data is stored securely in a **Room Database**.  
It also supports **theme switching (Light/Dark)** and lets you **change the currency** according to your preference.  
Dependency Injection is handled with **Hilt** for clean architecture.
